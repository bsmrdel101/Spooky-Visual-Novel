  BodyText: "Sitting in the pilot seat Percy watches the Earth grow so large it takes
    up the entire window. He moves only once, to deatch his 02 tank and plug in the
    second one. Continents become countries, become cities, become buildings. The
    hangar. Earth. Home. Dead bodies brought back to their families. The Serin crunches
    to an abrupt halt as the ship\u2019s autopilot places it on the landing strip
    and already the connection is made. Already Serin is everywhere."
