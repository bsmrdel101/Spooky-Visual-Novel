  BodyText: "Percy stops and looks down. At his feet, between the opening to both
    corridors, is a cold, mangled body. His neck is twisted, a ligature bruise around
    their neck such a dark purple it\u2019s almost black. His hands are blackened,
    worse at the fingertips where the tissue died first, signs of some infection
    from something or somewhere else. His jaw is broken and deformed, widened, teeth
    gone, tongue enlarged to animalistic proportions. The mouth is black."
